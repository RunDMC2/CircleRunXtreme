# Welcome to Circle Run Xtreme!

Circle Run Xtreme is an endless arcade-style game where you move around to collect different colored circles and stay in the game for as long as possible! A timer constantly ticks down as you move around the screen, and when it reaches 0, you lose! Different circles you collect will add time to the timer, allowing you to stay playing for longer, and may also award you with points or even an upgrade. Beware, however, as not all circles are good to collect: some circles may remove time from the timer or even give you a debuff! There are many different types of circles to discover and collect, as well as many different achievements to unlock. Play Circle Run Xtreme now, and try to earn a new high score!
